# Q: Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table. 
--- LIMIT: MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records

# Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number; 

# OFFSET specifies how many rows to skip within the result
# FETCH specifies how many rows from that point forward to return in the result.

IFNULL( expression, replacement ) 

# create table
CREATE TABLE tempemp
( id int NOT NULL,
  salary int
);

# input values
INSERT INTO tempemp
(id, salary)
VALUES 
(1,100);

INSERT INTO tempemp
(id, salary)
VALUES 
(2,200);

INSERT INTO tempemp
(id, salary)
VALUES 
(3,300);

# check table
select * from tempemp

# Solution 1
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), ---- Change the number after ‘offset’ gives u n-th highest salary, keeping "LIMIT 1"
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
    
# Solution 2   
SELECT MAX(SALARY) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM tempemp
WHERE SALARY < (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM tempemp);

# Solution 3 
SELECT Max(e1.Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM tempemp e1, tempemp e2 
WHERE e1.Salary < e2.Salary

# JOIN

# Look at information from multiple tables.

# Pet Example

## Inner join
# 1. a ROW will only be put in the final output table if the value in the column you're using to combine them shows up 
# in BOTH the tables you're joining
# 2. an INNER JOIN will NOT give you an output that's larger than your input tables

SELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name as Owner_Name --- not select ID columns
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o 
ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID

# JOIN
############

# Look at information from multiple tables.

##############
# Pet Example
##############

## Inner join
# 1. a ROW will only be put in the final output table if the value in the column you're using to combine them shows up 
# in BOTH the tables you're joining
# 2. an INNER JOIN will NOT give you an output that's larger than your input tables

SELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name as Owner_Name --- not select ID columns
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p
INNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o 
ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID

# Q: How many commits (recorded in the "sample_commits" table) have been made in repos written in the Python programming language? 
# (I'm looking for the number of commits per repo for all the repos written in Python.

# Note: I'll want to JOIN the sample_files and sample_commits questions to answer this.
#       I can figure out which files are written in Python by filtering results from the "sample_files" table using 
#       WHERE path LIKE '%.py'. This will return results where the "path" column ends in the text ".py", which is one way to identify which files have Python code.

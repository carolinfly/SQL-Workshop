order by

## Order by

# numeric column
SELECT ID, Name, Animal
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`
ORDER BY ID

# text column
SELECT ID, Name, Animal
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`
ORDER BY Animal

# DESC
SELECT ID, Name, Animal
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`
ORDER BY Animal DESC


## Format
DATE format: YYYY-[M]M-[D]D
DATETIME/TIMESTAMP format: YYYY-[M]M-[D]D[( |T)[H]H:[M]M:[S]S[.DDDDDD]][time zone]

## Getting only part of a date 

# Day
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`

# Week
SELECT EXTRACT(WEEK FROM column_with_timestamp)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`

## Example: Which day of the week do the most fatal motor accidents happen on?

## Q1: Which hours of the day do the most accidents occur during?
########

# Return a table that has information on how many accidents occurred in each hour of the day in 2015, sorted by the the number of accidents which occurred each day. Use either the accident_2015 or accident_2016 table for this, and the timestamp_of_crash column. (Yes, there is an hour_of_crash column, but if you use that one you won't get a chance to practice with dates. :P)

## Q2: Which state has the most hit and runs?
#########

# Return a table with the number of vehicles registered in each state that were involved in hit-and-run accidents, sorted by the number of hit and runs. Use either the vehicle_2015 or vehicle_2016 table for this, especially the registration_state_name and hit_and_run columns.

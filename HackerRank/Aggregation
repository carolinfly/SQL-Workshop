# Replace; Ceil
SELECT CEIL(AVG(Salary)-AVG(REPLACE(Salary,'0',''))) FROM EMPLOYEES; ---round up to the next integer.

Note: An aggregate may not appear in the WHERE clause unless it is in a subquery contained in a HAVING clause or a select list, 
and the column being aggregated is an outer reference.


# solution 1: MS SQL Server
with maxtable as
(select Employee_id, max(months*salary) as max
from Employee
where months*salary=(select max(months*salary) as max 
from Employee) 
group by employee_id)

select max, count(employee_id)
from maxtable
group by max

# solution 2:
select salary*months as earnings, count(*) from employee
group by earnings
order by earnings desc limit 1;

# solution 3:
select salary*months as earnings, count(*) from employee
group by 1 ---group by first column from SELECT 
order by 1 desc limit 1 ---print the first line
